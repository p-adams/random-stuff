On this day, Adam was created and on this day he died, on this day the Trumpet will be blown, and on this day all creatures will swoon. So send a great deal of salah upon me on this day, for your salah will be presented to me." They said: "O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), how will our salah be presented to you when you have decomposed (after death)?" He said: "Allah (SWT), the Mighty and Sublime, has forbidden the earth to consume the bodies of the prophets, peace be upon them."</h5>

        	<h2>Mawlid al-Nabi</h2><br>
        <h5>According to the well-known view, the Prophet (saw) was born shortly after the Year of the Elephant (570 CE), in the month of Rabi-l Awwal on a Monday.</h5>
        <h5>For centuries Muslims have observed this day as a day of celebration.</h5>
        <h5>al-Imam al-Suyuti mentions in al-Hawi li-l Fatawi that: "To commemorate the Mawlid, which is basically gathering people together, reciting parts of the Qu'ran, narrating stories about the Prophet's birth and the signs that accompanied it, then serving food, and afterwards, departing, is one of the good innovations; and the one who practices it gets rewarded, because it involves venerating the status of the Prophet and expressing joy for his honorable birth.</h5>
       <h5>Imam Abu Shama said, "One of the best innovations in our time is what is being done every year on the Prophet's birthday, such as giving charity, doing good deeds, displaying ornaments, and expressing joy, for that expresses the feelings of love and veneration for him in the hearts of those who are celebrating, and also, shows thankfulness to Allah for His bounty by sending His Messenger, the one who has been sent as a Mercy to the worlds."</h5>
        <h5>Imam Al Shihab Al Qastalani in al-Mawahib Al Ladunniya said, "May Allah have mercy on the one who turns the nights of the month of the Prophet's birth into festivities in order to decrease the suffering of those whose hearts are filled with disease and sickness." </h5>

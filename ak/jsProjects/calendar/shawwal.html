        	<h3>Shawwal</h3><br>

        <h5>The month of Shawwal is the tenth lunar month of the Islamic calendar. Shawwal was named during the pre-Islamic era and its name is said to be derived from the shala (to become sparse) as it was the time in which camel's milk was in short supply due to extreme heat. Among the virtues of Shawwal is that it contains Eid al-Fitr and marks the beginning of the hajj season.</h5>

        	<h2>Friday (al-Jumu'ah)</h2>
                <h5> It was narrated from Aws bin Aws that :
                The Prophet (ﷺ) said: "One of the best of your days is Friday. On this day, Adam was created and on this day he died, on this day the Trumpet will be blown, and on this day all creatures will swoon. So send a great deal of salah upon me on this day, for your salah will be presented to me." They said: "O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), how will our salah be presented to you when you have decomposed (after death)?" He said: "Allah (SWT), the Mighty and Sublime, has forbidden the earth to consume the bodies of the prophets, peace be upon them."</h5>
                <h5>Merits of Friday<ul><br>
                    <li>The Friday prayer. Regarding the Friday prayer Allah Most High said: "O you who believe, when the call for prayer is made on Friday, hasten, set off, to the remembrance of God, to the prayer, and leave aside [all] commerce, suspend [all] such contracts. That is better for you, should you know, that it is better for you, then do it" (62:9).<br>
                        <br>
                        Some recommended acts of attending the Friday prayer:<ul>
                        <li>Taking a purificatory bath</li>
                        <li>Arriving early</li>

        	<h2>Eid al-Fitr</h2><br>

        <h5>The Eid al-Fitr prayer is one of the best optional prayers. The prayer itself is recommended according to al-Imam al-Shafi'i, but other imams, such as Imam Abu Hanifah considered it obligatory. The time for the eid prayer enters after sunrise and lasts until noon; however, it is best to delay its performance until the sun has risen a spear's length in the sky. Some other recommended features of the eid pray include: </h5>
        <ul>
        <li>Performing the prayer in a masjid.</li>
        <li>Spending the night leading upto eid in worship.</li>
        <li>Performing the purificatory bath</li>
        <li>Wearing perfume (for men) and nice clothing</li>
        <li>To arrive early and to travel on foot.</li>
        <li>To eat something before performing the eid prayer</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>How is the prayer peformed?</h5>
        <h5>The eid prayer consists of two raka'ats. In the first rakat, it is recommened to make seven takbirs (excluding the opening takbir of the prayer) after reading the opening supplication, and to make five takbirs in the second rakat. It is recommended to raise one's hands for each takbir, and to read: "Glory be to Allah, all praise belongs to Allah, there is no god but Allah, Allah is the greatest" after each takbir. After the prayer is finished, if one is performing the prayer with a group, it is recommended that the prayer be followed by two sermons (similar to the Friday sermons).</h5>
        <h5>Zakat al-Fitr:</h5>
        <h5>It is obligatory to give zakat al-fitr in the Shafi'i school. It can be distributed anytime during Ramadhan but it must be given before sunset on the day of eid. However, it is before to give zakat al-fitr right before performing the eid prayer. Zakat al-fitr consists of giving 2.75 kilos of the staple food of the land for oneself and everyone else one is obliged to support (wife, children, etc) provided one's money exceeds one's expenses.</h5>

According to the Shafi'i scholars, it is best to fast the six days of Shawwal consecutively.</h5>

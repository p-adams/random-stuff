        	<h3>Dhu-l Hijjah</h3><br>

         <h5>Dhu-l Hijjah is the twelfth and final lunar month of the Islamic calendar. Dhu-l Hijjah refers to the annual pilgrimage. The most important act one can perform during this month is the hajj, which, like 'umrah, is obligatory (once in a lifetime) on every adult Muslim who can afford to go to Makkah during the hajj season, whether on foot or by any other carriage, and is physically and legally able to perform the pilgrimage. The first ten days of Dhu-l Hijjah are among the most magnificent days in Islamic calendar. The Holy Prophet (saw)has said, "One fast during these days is equal to the fasting of one complete year, and the worship of one night during this period is equal to the worship in the Night of Power.</h5>

        	<h2>Friday (al-Jumu'ah)</h2>
                <h5> It was narrated from Aws bin Aws that :
                The Prophet (ﷺ) said: "One of the best of your days is Friday. On this day, Adam was created and on this day he died, on this day the Trumpet will be blown, and on this day all creatures will swoon. So send a great deal of salah upon me on this day, for your salah will be presented to me." They said: "O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), how will our salah be presented to you when you have decomposed (after death)?" He said: "Allah (SWT), the Mighty and Sublime, has forbidden the earth to consume the bodies of the prophets, peace be upon them."</h5>
                <h5>Merits of Friday<ul><br>
                    <li>The Friday prayer. Regarding the Friday prayer Allah Most High said: "O you who believe, when the call for prayer is made on Friday, hasten, set off, to the remembrance of God, to the prayer, and leave aside [all] commerce, suspend [all] such contracts. That is better for you, should you know, that it is better for you, then do it" (62:9).<br>
                        <br>
                        Some recommended acts of attending the Friday prayer:<ul>
                        <li>Taking a purificatory bath</li>
                        <li>Arriving early</li>
                        <li>Listening attentively to the Friday sermons</li>
                        <li>Reciting Quran and making remembrance of Allah Most High</li>
                        </ul></li><br>
                    <li>Performing the dawn prayer with a group on Friday</li>
                    <li>The one who dies on Friday will be saved from the trials of the grave.</li>

        	<h2>Day of Arafah</h2>
        <br>
        <h5>This is the date when the pilgrims assemble on the plain of 'Arafat, six miles away from Makkah , where they perform the most essential part of the prescribed duties of hajj, namely, standing at Arafah.</h5>
        <h5>For those not performing hajj, it is recommended to fast on this day due to the hadith of the Prophet (saw): "Fasting on the Day of 'Arafah absolves the sins for two years: the previous year and the coming year, and fasting on 'Ashura, (the tenth day of Muharram) atones for the sins of previous years." As well as: "Four things the Prophet (saw) never neglected: Observing fast on the day of 'Ashura, 'Arafat, three days every month, and offering the sunnas of dawn prayer early in the morning."</h5>
        <h5>Beginning from the Fajr of the 9th Dhu-l Hijjah, up to the 'Asr prayer of the 13th, it is recommended for each Muslim to recite the Takbir of Tashriq after every fard prayer in the following words: 

            <em>Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar,

            La Ilaha Illallahu, Wallahu Akbar,

            Allahu Akbar wa lillahilhamd.</em>

        (There is no god but Allah and Allah is the greatest, Allah is the greatest and to Allah belongs all praise.) </h5>

        	<h2>Eid al-Adha</h2><br>
        <h5>The Eid al-Adha prayer is one of the best optional prayers. The prayer itself is recommended according to al-Imam al-Shafi'i, but other imams, such as Imam Abu Hanifah considered it obligatory. The time for the eid prayer enters after sunrise and lasts until noon; however, it is best to delay its performance until the sun has risen a spear's length in the sky. Some other recommended features of the eid pray include: </h5>
        <ul>
        <li>Performing the prayer in a masjid.</li>
        <li>Spending the night leading upto eid in worship.</li>
        <li>Performing the purificatory bath</li>
        <li>Wearing perfume (for men) and nice clothing</li>
        <li>To arrive early and to travel on foot.</li>
        <li>To refrain from eating anything until after the eid prayer</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>How is the prayer peformed?</h5>
        <h5>The eid prayer consists of two raka'ats. In the first rakat, it is recommended to make seven takbirs (excluding the opening takbir of the prayer) after reading the opening supplication, and to make five takbirs in the second rakat. It is recommended to raise one's hands for each takbir, and to read: "Glory be to Allah, all praise belongs to Allah, there is no god but Allah, Allah is the greatest" after each takbir. After the prayer is finished, if one is performing the prayer with a group, it is recommended that the prayer be followed by two sermons (similar to the Friday sermons).</h5>
        <h5>The Udhiya Slaughter:</h5>
        <h5>The slaughter of Eid al Adha is a confirmed sunna for the morally responsible Muslims who are able to sacrifice. It is only valid to slaughter camels, cattle, sheep, or goats, and the animals must be free of any defect that diminishes the quality of their meat. It is sunna for males to slaughter themselves if they can slaughter well, although it is valid to commission someone else to do it on their behalf. The time for slaughtering enters after sunrise once enough time has passed to perform two short rakas and two short khutbas. Before this time, it is not valid to slaughter. It remains valid to slaughter until sunset on the 13th of Dhul-Hijja.  It is disliked to slaughter during the night. If one made the sacrifice obligatory upon oneself by vowing it, one must give away the entire animal in charity (including the hide, horns, and hooves) and it is forbidden (haram) for one to eat from it. If the sacrifice was a sunna sacrifice (meaning that one did not vow it), it is permissible to eat from the meat of the sacrifice, although some of it (meaning any non-trivial (ghayr tafih) amount) must be given away to the poor.</h5>

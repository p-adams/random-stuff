        	<h3>Rajab</h3><br>

        <h5>Rajab is the seventh lunar month of the Islamic calendar and was named in the year 412 CE during the time of Kilab bin Murrah. Rajab  is derived from the word rajaba which means "to be awed by" because the pre-Islamic Arabs used to revere it and would prohibit fighting during this month. The month of Rajab is one of the four inviolable months mentioned in the Quran and hadith (click on the month of Muharram for more details). Some suggest that the reason for having an inviolable month, in which fighting is prohibited, in the middle of the year was so that people can safely travel and perform 'umrah.</h5>
         <h5>According to some of the Shafi'i scholars, the month of Rajab is the most virtous inviolable month. al-Nawawi and others maintained that Muharram is the most virtous while others considered Dhu-l Hijjah the most virtous. Rajab is given special consideration because it is the month in which the Prophet made his night journey from Makkah to Jerusalem and then to the heavens (Isra wa-l Mi'raj).</h5>
         <h5>The Prophet (saw) used to make the following supplication when Rajab came: "“O Allah! Bless us during Rajab and Sha’ban, and let us reach Ramadan."</h5>
         <h5>Ibn Rajab mentions in Lata'if al-Ma'arif that there are no special devotions performed during the month of Rajab.</h5>
        <h5>Important events that took place in Rajab: </h5>
         <ul>
         <li>The Prophet's ascent to the heavens (click on date highlighted in brown).</li>
             <li>The first emigration to Ethiopia.</li>
             <li>The Battle of Tabuk (9 AH).</li>

        	<h2>Friday (al-Jumu'ah)</h2>
                <h5> It was narrated from Aws bin Aws that :
                The Prophet (ﷺ) said: "One of the best of your days is Friday. On this day, Adam was created and on this day he died, on this day the Trumpet will be blown, and on this day all creatures will swoon. So send a great deal of salah upon me on this day, for your salah will be presented to me." They said: "O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), how will our salah be presented to you when you have decomposed (after death)?" He said: "Allah (SWT), the Mighty and Sublime, has forbidden the earth to consume the bodies of the prophets, peace be upon them."</h5>
                <h5>Merits of Friday<ul><br>

        	<h2>Isra wa-l Mi'raj</h2><br>

        <h5>
        The incident of al-Isra wa-l Mi'raj was recorded by Muslim and others on the authority of Malik bin Sasaa who said: The Prophet said, "While I was at the House in a state midway between sleep and wakefulness, (an angel recognized me) as the man lying between two men. A golden tray full of wisdom and belief was brought to me and my body was cut open from the throat to the lower part of the abdomen and then my abdomen was washed with Zam-zam water and (my heart was) filled with wisdom and belief. Al-Buraq, a white animal, smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey was brought to me and I set out with Gabriel. When I reached the nearest heaven. Gabriel said to the heaven gate-keeper, 'Open the gate.' The gatekeeper asked, 'Who is it?' He said, 'Gabriel.' The gate-keeper asked, 'Who is accompanying you?' Gabriel said, 'Muhammad.' The gate-keeper said, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel said, 'Yes.' Then it was said, 'He is welcomed. What a wonderful visit his is!' Then I met Adam and greeted him and he said, 'You are welcomed O son and a Prophet.'</h5>
        <h5>Then we ascended to the second heaven. It was asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel said, 'Gabriel.' It was said, 'Who is with you?' He said, 'Muhammad' It was asked, 'Has he been sent for?' He said, 'Yes.' It was said, 'He is welcomed. What a wonderful visit his is!" Then I met Jesus and Yahya (John) who said, 'You are welcomed, O brother and a Prophet.' Then we ascended to the third heaven. It was asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel said, 'Gabriel.' It was asked, 'Who is with you? Gabriel said, 'Muhammad.' It was asked, 'Has he been sent for?' 'Yes,' said Gabriel. 'He is welcomed. What a wonderful visit his is!' - (The Prophet added:). -There I met Joseph and greeted him, and he replied, 'You are welcomed, O brother and a Prophet!' Then we ascended to the 4th heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There I met Idris and greeted him. He said, 'You are welcomed O brother and Prophet.' Then we ascended to the 5th heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in previous heavens. There I met and greeted Aaron who said, 'You are welcomed O brother and a Prophet". Then we ascended to the 6th heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There I met and greeted Moses who said, 'You are welcomed O brother and a Prophet.' When I proceeded on, he started weeping and on being asked why he was weeping, he said, 'O Lord! Followers of this youth who was sent after me will enter Paradise in greater number than my followers.' Then we ascended to the seventh heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There I met and greeted Abraham who said, 'You are welcomed O son and a Prophet.' Then I was shown Al-Bait-al-Ma'mur (i.e. Allah's House). I asked Gabriel about it and he said, This is Al Bait-ul-Ma'mur where 70,000 angels perform prayers daily and when they leave they never return to it (but always a fresh batch comes into it daily).'</h5> 
        <h5>Then I was shown Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. a tree in the seventh heaven) and I saw its Nabk fruits which resembled the clay jugs of Hajr (i.e. a town in Arabia), and its leaves were like the ears of elephants, and four rivers originated at its root, two of them were apparent and two were hidden. I asked Gabriel about those rivers and he said, 'The two hidden rivers are in Paradise, and the apparent ones are the Nile and the Euphrates.' Then fifty prayers were enjoined on me. I descended till I met Moses who asked me, 'What have you done?' I said, 'Fifty prayers have been enjoined on me.' He said, 'I know the people better than you, because I had the hardest experience to bring Bani Israel to obedience. Your followers cannot put up with such obligation. So, return to your Lord and request Him (to reduce the number of prayers.' I returned and requested Allah (for reduction) and He made it forty. I returned and (met Moses) and had a similar discussion, and then returned again to Allah for reduction and He made it thirty, then twenty, then ten, and then I came to Moses who repeated the same advice. Ultimately Allah reduced it to five. When I came to Moses again, he said, 'What have you done?' I said, 'Allah has made it five only.' He repeated the same advice but I said that I surrendered (to Allah's Final Order)' " Allah's Apostle was addressed by Allah, "I have decreed My obligation and have reduced the burden on My slaves, and I shall reward a single good deed as if it were ten good deeds."</h5>
